    "text": "Description\nThe image presents a horizontal bar chart titled “Top 20 Counties by Income Inequality (Gini Index)”, based on data from the American Community Survey (ACS) 2020. It visualizes the counties in the United States with the highest levels of income inequality, as measured by the Gini Index. The Gini Index values range approximately from 0.55 to over 0.66, with higher values indicating greater inequality. Harding County, New Mexico ranks highest, followed closely by East Carroll Parish, Louisiana and Humphreys County, Mississippi. The source of the data is clearly cited in the caption at the bottom right: “Data Source: ACS 2020”. This chart effectively highlights geographic areas in the U.S. with the most pronounced income disparities."
