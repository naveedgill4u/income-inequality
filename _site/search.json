Income Inequality Deeply thankful to Preceptor for organizing free Data Science Bootcamp and illuminating us with knowldege of current era in Data Science. üåê David Kane‚Äôs Free Data Science Bootcamp\n\nAuthor is an expert in Finance, accounts and audit with qualification of Master of Philisophy in Business Management from Pakistan, and lerning Data Analysis from Kane‚Äôs Data Science Bootcamp. Income inequality is hot topic at agenda of Nations because for inclusive development, it is mandatory to minimize gap of income inequality among people. Income inequality is not only burning issue for developing nations but also for developed countires. In this document author has explained a picture of income inequality among 20 counties having higest level of income inequality in USA. The document is prepared by accessing data from American Community Servey (ACS) 2020. The document has two expositions of income inequality; first in the form of graph showing name of counties on Y axis and Gini Index on X axis. Scond, an interactive map of these counties with Gini Index of income inequality, the reder may click on map to see the figures in zoom."

It visualizes the counties in the United States with the highest levels of income inequality, as measured by the Gini Index. The Gini Index values range approximately from 0.55 to over 0.66, with higher values indicating greater inequality. Harding County, New Mexico ranks highest, followed closely by East Carroll Parish, Louisiana and Humphreys County, Mississippi. The source of the data is clearly cited in the caption at the bottom right: ‚ÄúData Source: ACS 2020‚Äù. This chart effectively highlights geographic areas in the U.S. with the most pronounced income disparities."
